A shiny dashboard to describe current patterns of OPD utilization in 2018. It only consider consumers 18 years and over.

This has a two fold aim. To understand the current utilization patterns, so ideally surfacing any opportunities 
for optimization. The second is as a proff of concept for developing a shiny app that can be developed, provide useful information and be deployed into the business.

It currently displays static information on current utilization, age and ethnicity profiles. The interactive portions are about clinic utilization by locality and by individual clinics.

Version 1.1
The application has been updated to include an analysis of the referral sources, and a breakdown of the requests in those referrals by clinic type. Some bug fixes and code optimizations have also been undertaken.
