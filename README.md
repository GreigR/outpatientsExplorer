A shiny dashboard to describe current patterns of OPD utilization in 2018.

This has a two fold aim. To understand the current utilization patterns, so ideally surfacing any opportunities 
for optimization. The second is as a proff of concept for developing a shiny app that can be developed, provide useful information and be deployed into the business.
