A shiny dashboard to describe current patterns of OPD utilization in 2018. It only consider consumers 18 years and over.

This has a two fold aim. To understand the current utilization patterns, so ideally surfacing any opportunities 
for optimization. The second is as a proof of concept for developing a shiny app that can be developed, provide useful information and be deployed into the business.

It currently displays static information on current utilization, age and ethnicity profiles. The interactive portions are about clinic utilization by locality and by individual clinics.

Version 1.1
The application has been updated to include an analysis of the referral sources, and a breakdown of the requests in those referrals by clinic type. Some bug fixes and code optimization have also been undertaken.

Version 2.0
The application was reworked to focus on the external and internal demand driving the clinic processes. The concept being that follow-up appoints are easily internally amenable to change in the model of care.Changing external demand involves changes in the model of care across the district, and the adoption of some common approach through a Clinical Care Pathway.
